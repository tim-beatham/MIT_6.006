    "## Single-Source Shortest Path Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we want to find the shortest distance from one vertex to another. This problem can be hard to solve as even with a relatively small number of vertices it would take a long time (many years) to find the shortest path to a given vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a graph is weighted it means there is a cost to go from one vertex to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph can have negative weights. One example is when a taxi gets from one destination to another a negative weight could represent money earned and a positive weight could represent money spent on fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a graph has a negative cycle then certain shortest paths are undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-Source Shortest Path algorithms work by setting the starting node to have a cost of 0 and all other nodes to having a cost of infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we select an edge (u, v).\n",
    "\n",
    "If d[v] > d[u] + w(u, v) then we update d[v] to d[u] + w(u, v). We also set π[v] = u. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where d is a list of all the distances to the other nodes and π is a list of all the parents of the other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We repeat this until all d[v] <= d[u] + w(u, v)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence this means that d has converged to the actual shortest path from one vertex to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal Substructure\n",
    "\n",
    "Theorem: Subpaths of shortest paths are shortest paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Triangle Inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "Theorem: For all u, v, x ∈ X we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "δ(u,v)<= δ(u,x) +δ(x,v)\n",

    "## Dijikstra's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Only works for graphs in which every edge has a positive weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm finds the shortest path from a given vertex to every other vertex in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the weight of the starting vertex to 0 and all other vertices to infinity and add the distances to a priority queue.\n",
    "2. Pop from the priority queue and assign to variable v.\n",
    "3. Update the weight of adjacent nodes to the vertex v if the cost is lower.\n",
    "4. Repeat 2-3 until the priority queue is empty.\n",
